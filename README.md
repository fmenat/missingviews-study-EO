A public repository of our work in missing views for Earth Observation (EO) applications.

### Data
Preprocessed data can be accessed at: [Link](https://cloud.dfki.de/owncloud/index.php/s/yxAfArTXkMF7nM2)

### Additional source
We use the following source for multi-view learning: [https://github.com/fmenat/mvlearning](https://github.com/fmenat/mvlearning)

### Training
* To train a single-view learning model (e.g. Input-level fusion):  
```
python train_singleview.py -s config/input.yaml
```

* To train all the views individually with single-view learning (e.g. for single-view predictions or Ensemble-based fusion):  
```
python train_singleview_pool.py -s config/pool.yaml
```

* To train a multi-view learning model (e.g. Feature-level fusion, Decision-level fusion, Gated Fusion, Feature-level fusion with MultiLoss):  
```
python train_multiview.py -s config/mv_feat.yaml
```

* To train a multi-view learning model with CCA searching in case of missing views:  
```
python train_multiview_cca.py -s config/mv_cca.yaml
```

### Evaluation
* To evaluate the model by its predictive quality:
```
python evaluate_predictions.py -s config/evaluation.yaml
```

* To evaluate the model by its predictive robustness:
```
python evaluate_rob_pred.py -s config/evaluation.yaml
```
